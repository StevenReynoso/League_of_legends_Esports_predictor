League of Legends Esports Match Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the outcome of League of Legends esports matches. The model is trained on historical match data and can be used to predict the winner of future matches.

The model will train on the historical match data and then make predictions for the test set. The accuracy of the model will be displayed, along with a confusion matrix showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Future Work

There are several areas where this project could be extended in the future. For example:

    Adding additional features to the model, such as player statistics or team rankings
    Using a neural network or other machine learning algorithm to improve prediction accuracy
    Building a web interface for users to input match data and get predictions in real-time
